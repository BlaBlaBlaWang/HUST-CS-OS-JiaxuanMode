## README

* lab 1 is equipped with a  plain UI.

* lab 2 has two parts, as the filename suggests.

* lab 3 has a macro in the source code named ``UNIT_SIZE``, to adjust the size of the shared-memory unit in bytes. 

  To use the executable file ,you may use a terminal like this:``./shmlab [inputfilename] [outputfilename]``

  *A small bug exists, though, which occurs when the ``UNIT_SIZE`` is critically smaller than the file to copy, I am still working on it for its perfection.*

* lab 4 is suggested to be used under mount points like /home in linux. Or the output may be incorrect.
